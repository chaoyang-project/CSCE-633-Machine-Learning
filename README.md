# CSCE-633-Machine-Learning
HW1: Linear Perceptron Algorithm + KNN

HW2: Machine learning with Pokemon GO

HW3: Maximum likelihood estimate + Machine learning for facial recognition (FNN + CNN)

HW4: Classify benign and malignant tumors (Decision Tree + Random Forest)

HW5: Team project (Build machine learning models to perform COVID-19 diagnosis from chest Xray images)

What I have done for the group: crop and resize the images, extract vertical and horizontal edges, extract HoG feature, train SVM classifier and RandomForest classifier with HOG features.
